# Title     : IML_project
# Objective : Implement the data processing described in the papers
# Created by: Aur√©lien
# Created on: 13/10/2021

# Identify episodes equivalent to indentifing breaks
# calculate metrics for each episode

# Need to get the Ln(GDPPC) by year for every country

# GDPPC = GDP/population
# GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports
# Net exports = Exports - Imports
# GDDPC = rgdpl
